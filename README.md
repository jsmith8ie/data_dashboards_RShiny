# data_dashboards_RShiny
This app was created for the MM961 module, which required an app to be developed for FAO food supply data. The app is written in R. It can be run using the shiny library function runGitHub("data_dashboards_RShiny", "jsmith8ie") in RStudio. 
In order for the graphs and tables to display as expected, the dataset needs to be downloaded, which is available in the "Download Dataset" tab.
